# Road Accident Analysis using Power BI

This project focuses on analyzing road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022 to uncover critical insights using Power BI. The analysis is designed to support various stakeholders such as the Ministry of 
Transport, Road Safety Corps, and Traffic Management Agencies by providing actionable metrics related to accident frequency, severity, and contributing factors.

The dashboard showcases key performance indicators (KPIs) including total casualties, accident severity trends, monthly comparisons, and breakdowns by road type, vehicle type, and location. The interactive report 
facilitates year-over-year (YoY) comparisons and enables stakeholders to make informed decisions for improving road safety infrastructure and emergency response systems.

## Key Features:

* Dynamic Power BI dashboard for 2021â€“2022 accident data.
* KPIs: Total Casualties, Total Accidents, Casualties by Severity and Vehicle Type.
* Monthly trend analysis comparing casualties in 2021 vs 2022.
* Casualty distribution by Road Type, Area (Urban/Rural), and Day/Night.
* Location-based visualizations highlighting high-risk zones.
* Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.
* Use of DAX to calculate YoY growth and time-based metrics.
* Custom visuals, interactive filters, and drill-down functionality.
* Designed for multiple stakeholders including law enforcement, transportation authorities, and the general public.

## Tools and Technologies:

* Microsoft Power BI (Data visualization and reporting)
* Power Query (Data cleaning and transformation)
* DAX (Measures and calculated KPIs)
* SQL Server Management Studio (Initial data querying)
* Microsoft Excel (Prototype dashboard)
* PowerPoint (Report background design)

This project demonstrates end-to-end BI report development including data ingestion, cleaning, modeling, visualization, and final dashboard publication.
