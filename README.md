# Road-Accident-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

## 🚧 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard using Power BI
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. It delivers key performance insights aimed at supporting informed decision-making by governmental and public safety stakeholders. The goal is to monitor accident severity, detect patterns, and guide safety interventions on roads.

## 📌 Problem Statement
The primary objective is to build a data-driven dashboard to:
* Monitor road accident trends over time.
* Evaluate total casualties and accidents with year-over-year (YoY) growth.
* Understand the severity and contributing factors of accidents.
* Provide actionable insights to reduce road mishaps.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Implemented
* 🟢 Primary KPIs:
1. **Total Casualties (Current Year vs Previous Year) with YoY Growth**
2. **Total Accidents (Current Year vs Previous Year) with YoY Growth**
3. **Casualties by Accident Severity (Current Year vs Previous Year) with YoY Growth**

## * 🔵 Secondary KPIs:
1. **Casualties by Vehicle Type (Current Year)**
2. **Monthly Casualty Trend Comparison (2021 vs 2022)**
3. **Casualties by Road Type (Current Year)**
4. **Casualties by Area (Urban/Rural) and Time of Day (Day/Night)**
5. **Casualties and Accidents by Geographic Location**

* Data Transformation and Processing
* Creation of a Date Table and use of Time Intelligence Functions
* Data Modeling (Establishing Relationships Between Tables)
* DAX for Calculating YTD and YoY Metrics
* Custom Columns and Measures
* KPI and Advanced KPI Cards
* Dynamic Visualizations (Bar, Line, Pie, Map Charts)
* Report Branding and Image Imports
* Exporting and Sharing Reports with End Users
